# Basic DSP Algorithms
 A collection of basic audio DSP algrithms written in C++ 
 
 Signal Statistics
 The signal statistics folder contains basic and robust algorithms for finding basic statistics of a signal including:
 - Signal mean
 - Signal Standard Deviation
 - Signal Variance
 - Signal Root Mean Squared
 Robust versions of the algorithms employ loop unrolling for optimization. 
 
 Convolution
 The convolution folder includes one basic algorithm for signal convolution. The example impulse response can be used for high pass filtering of an input signal.
